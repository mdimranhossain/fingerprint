I have a fingerprint image dataset in /src/data/dataset/ there 10 image for a person, pattern is 1__M_Left_index_finger (id)_(sex)(hand)_(finger_name), can you use this dataset for this project?

Yes, this dataset can be used for the project. To proceed, consider the following preprocessing steps:
1. Parse the filenames to extract metadata (id, sex, hand, finger name).
2. Normalize the images (e.g., resizing, grayscale conversion).
3. Augment the dataset if needed (e.g., rotations, flips).
4. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
5. Ensure proper labeling for supervised learning tasks.
