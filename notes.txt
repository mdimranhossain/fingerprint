### Explanation of Changes
1. **Logarithmic Growth Model**:
   - Used `np.log1p(years)` to calculate realistic changes over time.
   - This ensures that changes grow more slowly and realistically over time.

2. **Growth Rates**:
   - Adjusted growth rates for `minutiae`, `ridge_endings`, and `ridge_bifurcations` to ensure realistic changes:
     - `minutiae`: 2% growth rate.
     - `ridge_endings`: 1% growth rate.
     - `ridge_bifurcations`: 1.5% growth rate.
